### Explanation

### This code is about chunking and embedding documents.

1) data.mjs - Holds 4 text docs aroung 2000 words each
2) index.mjs
    - createChunks - Splits docs into parts and makes sure the parts overlap
    - The remainder of the code is same as day 1

The change here is just how we split and chunk docs.
